//De-emphasis FIR filters:
//I chose not to implement a filter design algoritm for these, because:
// - they are defined by their frequency envelope, and I didn't want to implement the least squares or similar algorithm to design such filters
// - they are most likely needed at given fixed sample rates

// To generate the coefficients:
// invoke octive-cli
// Copy and paste the commands into the interactive command line below
// Run the appropriate call to mkdeemph()
